Resources

The NLTK book

The NLTK book covers almost all of the topics we will cover in this class, though not always with the same specifics and level of detail: we encourage you to take a look, but note that the lecture notebooks should take precedence!
Python documentation

Of particular relevance to this class is the documentation on string methods and regular expressions
Beautiful Soup (4) documentation

This gives a lengthy overview of the Beautiful Soup XML/HTML parsing package
